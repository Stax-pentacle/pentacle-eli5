## What
Traditional digital markets, like the NASDAQ stock exchange (as well as centralized crypto exchanges) work with matching engines built for so-called Limit Order Books: buyers and sellers have to offer up their goods at a certain price in a certain quantity, and wait to be matched with someone else to conduct a trade. This may sound simple in principle, but these orderbooks are a very competitive landscape where professional market makers compete with each other at split second speeds — it has been practically impossible to replicate this model on today's decentralized blockchains such as Ethereum.

## Why
Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are mathematical functions that make it possible for people to trade their coins on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) in a transparent way on the blockchain, without trusted intermediaries. Continuing with the comparison, they are a replacement for the matching engine used on traditional marketplaces, while the order books are replaced with so-called Liquidity Pools — kept in balance by the aforementioned AMM.

## Risk
Code bugs/exploits (unintended, many new and untested AMM algorithms). Scam coins / rugpulls — the market owner on e.g. coinbase makes sure only "legit" coins are available on their platform; not the case on permissionless DEXes...

## Reward
Exchange without trusted intermediaries. Sometimes the DEX protocols have their own coin which they give out as a reward to their users (as an airdrop or in form of yield for providing liquidity, for example). These coins get their value from governing future changes to the protocol they are connected to, typically.
