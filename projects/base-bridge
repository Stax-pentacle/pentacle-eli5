Base Bridge enables the transfer of certain digital assets and other data back and forth between Ethereum and Base.

Transferring from Base to Ethereum takes approximately 7 days. This is a security feature designed to help secure Base. If you prefer not to wait, you can alternatively use a third-party bridge which allows you to transfer assets much faster.
