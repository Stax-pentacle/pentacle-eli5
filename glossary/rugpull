## What
A rug pull is a common form of scam where a team abandons a project shortly after announcing it, or after attracting investor money or creating a liquidity pool takes all the money (or liquidity) and leaves. The name comes from the phrase “to pull the rug out” from under someone, as it evokes images of leaving a victim senseless and without anywhere to stand.

## Why
The anonymous nature of crypto makes it easier for unscrupulous individuals to take advantage of the relative ease to launch a project, have users deposit assets and then leave without much threat of consequences.
