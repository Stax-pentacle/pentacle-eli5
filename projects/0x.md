### What

0x is a developersâ€™ one-stop shop to build financial products on crypto rails. 0x provides developers with essential web3 tools to enable trading such as swaps, gasless infrastructure, limit orders, and token registries. Their suite of APIs has processed over 52 million transactions and USD 125B in volume trading on apps like Coinbase Wallet, Robinhood Wallet, Metamask, Zerion, Zapper, and more.

### Why

0x provides APIs and out-of-the-box solutions that allow third parties to reduce their infrastructure and development costs. For example, by using the API, developers can tap into aggregated multi-chain DEX liquidity and the API finds the best executed price across 70+ liquidity sources, both public (AMMs) and private (professional market makers), across multiple blockchains. 


### Risk

Using a third party solution means that developers take on the risk inhereted from that particualr solution, for example smart contract risks, bugs, or exploits that make products using 0x solutions also vulnerable. 


### Reward

Faster and cheaper development, simplification of the tech stack and introduction into an ecosystem of products and solutions using 0x products. e.g. Larger liquidity for better prices in swaps and trades.
