### What

Holyheld is a debit card that you connect to your crypto wallet(s). It allows you to spend the funds in your wallet(s) at the shops and online â€“ just as you would use a regular bank debit card. You can pay from your phone, and one day (soon) you may be able to order a metal card. 

### Why

Being able to spend your crypto straight from your crypto wallet via a debit card saves a bunch of pfaffing around that you'd traditionally take using a fiat offramp. 


### Risk

Your onchain transactions are protected up to $50,000 with their security partner Sherlock. 


### Reward

Unlimited 1% daily cashback on purchases for metal cardholders. Up to 0.5% for virtual cardholders. And all the time you save by not having to offramp.
