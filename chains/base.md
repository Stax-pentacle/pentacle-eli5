### What
Base is built as an Ethereum L2 on the OP stack, with the security, stability, and scalability you need to power your dapps. Confidently deploy any EVM codebase and onramp your users and assets from Ethereum L1, Coinbase, and other interoperable chains.

### Why
Get the EVM environment at a fraction of the cost. Get early access to Ethereum features like Account Abstraction (ERC4337), simple developer APIs for gasless transactions, and smart contract wallets.

### Risk
Bridging can take up to 7 days

### Reward
Baseâ€™s rollup architecture reduces costs by 10x for users.
